**This is a mock repository, for work I do at ModelMatch** 

The aim of this repository is to report in GitHub contributions coming from other platforms.

## Notice

The content of this repository contains mock code. This prevents private source code to be leaked. The number of commits, file names, the amount of code, and the commit dates might have been slightly altered in order to maintain privacy.

Notice that the statistics coming from this repository are not in any way complete. Commits only come from other selected git repositories. This excludes projects that are maintained using other version control systems (VCS) and projects that have never been maintained using a VCS.

## Reasons

GitHub shows contributions statistics of its users. There are [several reasons](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/627) why this feature could be debatable.

Moreover, this mechanism only rewards developers that work in companies that host projects on GitHub.
